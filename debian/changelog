  * Rewrite NSS Go library in C
    - due to random crashes caused by loading a multithreaded shared library
      written in Go from NSS, we now have a thin C wrapper calling a Go
      executable which does the actual queries
  * Add translations supported by gettext to the PAM module
    - to support the future CLI integration, these are shipped in a
      common architecture-independent package
  * Ship a configuration template in the common package
  * Fix segfault on interrupted pam conversation
  * Fix FTBFS on armhf due to int type size
  * Various test improvements and fixes
  * Update dependencies to latest:
    - github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-go
    - github.com/go-ini/ini
    - github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3
